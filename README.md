# BMEN 509/623 — Deliverable 2: X-ray and Computed Tomography

## 📅 Due Date: March 2, 2026

## Overview

This deliverable explores X-ray imaging physics and computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. You will analyze X-ray spectra, implement CT reconstruction algorithms, investigate image artifacts, and perform Hounsfield unit calibration.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the instructions**: Open `deliverable-02-instructions.pdf` for complete assignment details, learning objectives, and submission requirements.

2. **Complete the starter notebook**: Open `deliverable-02-starter.ipynb` in Jupyter and work through the exercises. The notebook contains scaffolded code cells and questions to guide your analysis.

3. **Explore the data**: The `data/` folder contains CT phantoms, sinograms, and calibration files needed for the exercises.

4. **Submit your work**: Upload your completed notebook to D2L by the due date.
